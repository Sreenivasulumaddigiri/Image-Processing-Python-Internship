# Image-Processing-Python-Internship
Created a Python script using OpenCV to realistically map a rectangular texture (Pattern.jpg) onto a curved flag surface (Flag.jpg), simulating natural folds and fabric deformation. This project was done during my time at ByteProLabs, focusing on image warping and perspectiveÂ transformation.
